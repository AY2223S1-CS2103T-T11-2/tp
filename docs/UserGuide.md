## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add p/POSITION`, `POSITION` is a parameter which can be used as `add p/Software Engineer`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `w/WEBSITE [t/TAG]` can be used as `w/careers.microsoft.com t/Urgent` or as `w/careers.microsoft.com`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Urgent`, `t/Urgent t/Remote` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `list`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

uniquely identified by its `COMPANY` and `POSITION` with no regards to case-sensitivity.<br>

a new one with `n/MICROSOFT p/Software Engineer` will be treated as a duplicate and will not be added.
